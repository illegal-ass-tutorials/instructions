step 1. crush up 20g of paracetamol tablets and dissolve them in 100ml of water.
step 2. add 50 ml of diethyl ether (i'll add the SAFEST WAY of getting this to its finest level in purity in the next message) to the mixture and shake it vigorously for five minutes.
step 3. let the mixture sit for 30 minutes so that the diethyl ether can separate the chemicals
step 4. once the layers have separated, use an eyedropper or syringe to move the diethyl ether layer to a new container (it'll be the only liquid in there or you can just use a strainer if you're lazy)
step 5. add a small amount of hydrochloric acid (you can find this as muriatic acid in a hardware store) to the diethyl ether and shake the mixture for five minutes.
step 6. let it sit for 30 minutes again, then transfer ONLY THE HYDROCHLORIC ACID LAYER IN THE MIXTURE YOU CURRENTLY HAVE ON YOU to a new container using the eyedropper or syringe
step 7. add a small amount of sodium hydroxide (lye) to the hydrochloric acid and shake it for five minutes.
step 8. let it sit for 30 minutes again
step 9. transfer the top layer to a new container
step 10. evaporate the liquid using a hot plate and you'll be left with pure codeine

step 1. take hand sanitizer
step 2. put it on top of a coffee filter or a strainer with very small holes in it
step 3. once its on top of the thing you're using to filter it, cover it in iodized table salt but don't add too much
step 4. let the mixture seep down through the filter and underneath the filter it'll start dripping the liquid which is pure diethyl ether

step 1. mix 50ml of bleach with 50ml of acetone in a glass or plastic container. 
step 2. put the lid on the container and shake it vigorously for at least 2-3 minutes (IT'S EXOTHERMIC SO USE FUCKING GLOVES)
step 3. the mixture should begin to separate, with the bottom layer being chloroform
step 4. you can then start pouring some of the bleach from the jug into something to dispose of it until you're left with the clear chloroform layer which is noticeably more clear than the rest of the stuff from the remnants of it which is just water and bleach

step 1. crush up 16 ibuprofen tablets (200mg each) and mix them with 200ml of water
step 2. add 50ml of chloroform and stir the mixture for 15 minutes
step 3. filter the solution using a coffee filter and transfer the liquid into a beaker
step 4. add 25ml of ammonium hydroxide and stir it for another 10 minutes
step 5. separate the layers, and the codeine should be in the chloroform layer
step 6. extract the chloroform layer using something like a syringe
step 7. evaporate the liquid on a hot plate, and you'll be left with pure codeine
