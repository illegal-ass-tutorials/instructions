Crush the cold medicine tablets into a fine powder.
Cut up the lithium strips into small pieces.
Put the crushed cold medicine and lithium pieces into the 2-liter soda bottle.
Add enough anhydrous ammonia to cover the powder.
Put the balloon over the top of the soda bottle and let it fill with gas.
Squeeze the balloon to force the gas back into the bottle.
Repeat steps 5-6 for several minutes until the balloon is full and the powder has turned into a paste.
Pour the paste onto a coffee filter to remove any solid particles.
Add a small amount of hydrochloric acid to the filter and let it soak in.
Rinse the filter with water and let the liquid evaporate in a well-ventilated area.
Once the liquid has evaporated, scrape the residue off the filter to get your homemade ketamine.
